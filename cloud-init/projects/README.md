## Project-Specific Cloud-Init
This directory is intended for storing project-specific cloud-init configurations. Each cloud-init file should be tailored to the needs of its associated project and include any relevant customization for initialization.

### Adding Project Configurations
For each project, create a subdirectory within this directory. Ensure that the configuration includes:

1. Project Name: The name of the project for clear identification.
2. Brief of Cloud-Init Tasks: An outline of the specific tasks or configurations that the cloud-init script will perform.
